                    <h1>Better than Expected!</h1>
                    <p>
                        I was worried that the bike would not be big enough for me, (6'1", 220) or powerful enough.
                        Wrong on
                        both counts. I rarely ride above Pedal Assist 2 and can't imagine needing more power. It's fast,
                        and
                        I don't need any more speed out of it. The fit and finish are great, very structurally sound.
                        Nothing feels cheap on it.

                    <h1>Feeling Like a Kid Again</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have had the Jd-20A06 for a month now and put on 160 miles. It is so cool to ride around the
                        neighborhood or around town feeling like a kid again. I have been folding it up and taking it
                        with me to different locations and then riding from there. I love it and definitely recommend
                        this company to anyone interested. I bought the foldable Jd-20A06 so I can take it anywhere and it is working out perfect. Thanks, Jiade Intelligent Technology

                    <p>
                        I purchased this bike after riding a friends JD Bike, he had a earlier version, I really enjoy
                        this bike. My wife picked up a JD-20A06-3, and we just enjoy taking our bikes out while camping.
                        It's been so much fun and we are seeing lots of sites we typically would not have seen. Highly
                        recommended these bikes
